# Supreme-Inspired Streetwear Ecommerce Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based**: Drawing inspiration from Supreme's iconic streetwear aesthetic - bold, minimalist, high-contrast design with strategic scarcity indicators and limited edition urgency. The design creates exclusivity through restraint, using whitespace as a luxury element while maintaining functional clarity for digital product discovery and instant checkout.

## Typography System

**Primary Font**: Use a condensed sans-serif from Google Fonts (Bebas Neue or Oswald) for all headings, product names, and CTAs
- Hero Headlines: text-6xl to text-8xl, uppercase, font-bold, tracking-tight
- Section Headers: text-4xl to text-5xl, uppercase, font-bold
- Product Titles: text-2xl to text-3xl, uppercase, font-semibold
- Category Labels: text-sm, uppercase, tracking-widest, font-bold

**Secondary Font**: Clean sans-serif (Inter or Roboto) for body text and UI elements
- Body Text: text-base, font-normal, leading-relaxed
- Product Descriptions: text-sm to text-base, leading-loose
- Buttons/CTAs: text-sm to text-base, uppercase, font-bold, tracking-wide
- Metadata (prices, dates): text-sm, font-medium

## Layout System

**Spacing Primitives**: Tailwind units of 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32
- Component padding: p-4 to p-8
